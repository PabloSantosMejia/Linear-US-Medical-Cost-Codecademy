Hi! This is my solution for the project US medical insurance cost open project from Codecademy. My scope was to create data analysis and to create a linear model to calculate the cost of insurance taking into account 5 variables (age, bmi, sex, number of children and smoker/non-smoker)

All input and code review is most welcome!
